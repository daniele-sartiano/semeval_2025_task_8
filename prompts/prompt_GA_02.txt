You are a pandas code generator.
Your goal is to complete the function below, that, given this DataFrame: {{df.head().to_json(orient='records')}}, returns the answer of type {{answer_type}} to question: {{question}}.
* Do not write redundant code.
* You only have access to pandas and numpy.
* Determine which columns contain data relevant to the answer.
* For each noun phrase in the question, build a groupby expression aggregating the corresponding columns.
* Filter the data through those expressions.
* Compute the requested answer.
* Pay attention to type conversions in aggregator functions.
* You cannot read files from disk.
* Don't write other functions.
* Don't overwrite variables.
* Don't use extra columns.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def answer(df: pd.DataFrame):
	df.columns = {{df.columns.to_list()}}
